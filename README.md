## Why do I need degiro-trading-tracker?

If you bought or sold more then few stocks with Degiro, it's tedious and hard to keep track of exact amount of money which was invested, or amount which was spent in fees. As each time you want to check one of these, you'll need to export Degiro "Transactions" `.xls` file, open it with Microsoft Excel/LibreOffice Calc and then do the calculations yourself.

This tool allows you to automatically display data of interest without even opening the `.xls` file.
